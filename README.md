**Neuradriz** is a pure JavaScript-based simple neural network library designed for Node.js. This module allows you to train a neural network with a single hidden layer and make predictions based on the trained data.

## Features

- **Pure JavaScript**: No dependencies or external libraries needed.
- **Feedforward Neural Network**: Supports networks with one hidden layer.
- **Backpropagation**: Includes backpropagation for training.
- **Flexible Input and Output Sizes**: You can define the number of input nodes, hidden nodes, and output nodes.
- **Customizable Learning Rate**: Set the learning rate for training as needed.
