We are open to new ideas! If you have a suggestion or would like to see a new feature in **Neuradriz**, you can:

1. Check if the feature is already requested or in progress by browsing the issues.

   - Any relevant use cases
3. Discuss your ideas with the community for feedback and improvements.

### 3. Submitting Code (Pull Requests)

#### Steps to Submit a Pull Request (PR):

1. **Fork the Repository**: Fork the project to your own GitHub account.

2. **Clone Your Fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/neuradriz.git

3. Create a New Branch: Use a descriptive branch name related to the changes you're making:

  ```bash
git checkout -b fix-bug-xyz


4. Make Your Changes: Implement your fix or feature. Try to keep the changes small and focused.


5. Run Tests: Make sure all existing tests pass and, if applicable, write new tests to cover your changes.


6. Commit Your Changes: Write a meaningful commit message:

  ```bash
git commit -m "Fix: Bug in weight initialization"


7. Push to Your Fork:

git push origin fix-bug-xyz


8. Submit a Pull Request: Open a PR to the main repository, providing a clear explanation of the changes you've made. Include any relevant issues your PR closes (e.g., Closes #issue-number).



## PR Guidelines:

Ensure your code follows the existing code style.

Add comments where necessary for clarity.

Include tests for any new functionality or bug fixes.

Ensure your PR has a meaningful title and description.


### 4. Improving Documentation

If you notice any typos or areas where the documentation could be clearer, feel free to contribute. Documentation updates are just as important as code contributions.

To contribute to documentation:

Follow the same process as submitting code, but make changes to relevant .md files (e.g., README.md or CONTRIBUTION.md).
